### The goal
My goal is to create to smallest docker container for my web static files. The advantage of Go is that you can generate a fully static binary, so that you don't need anything else.

### Features
 * A fully static web server in 5MB
 * Web server build for Docker
 * HTTPS by default
 * Can generate certificate on his onw
 * Light container
 * More security than official images (see below)
 * Log enabled

### Why?
Because the official Golang image is wayyyy to big (around 1/2Gb as you can see below) and could be unsecure.

For me, the whole point of containers is to have a light container...
Many links should provide you with additionnal info to see my point of view:

### How to use
```
// HTTPS server
docker run -d -p 443:8043 -v path/to/website:/srv/http --name goStatic pierrezemb/gostatic
// HTTP server
docker run -d -p 80:8043 -v path/to/website:/srv/http --name goStatic pierrezemb/gostatic --forceHTTP
```

### Wow, such container! What are you using?

I'm using [echo](http://echo.labstack.com/) as a  micro web framework because he has great performance, and [golang-builder](https://github.com/CenturyLinkLabs/golang-builder) to generate the static binary (command line in the makefile)

I'm also using the centurylink/ca-certs image instead of the scratch image to avoid this error:

```
x509: failed to load system roots and no roots provided
```

The centurylink/ca-certs image is simply the scratch image with the most common root CA certificates pre-installed. The resulting image is only 258 kB which is still a good starting point for creating your own minimal images.
